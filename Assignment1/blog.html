                <h3>This is Molly</h3>
                <p> Molly is an absolute maniac. She will bite your whole h*ckin finger off. Still I would take the risk a severed thumb, to pet her little noggin.
                Molly gets a 12/10 rating. She probably is a good pupper.

                <h3>This is Walter</h3> 
                <p> All he wants to do is dig huge holes in the garden and love you with his stinky doggo breath.
                    But Walter is a proud father of 8 tiny weirdly shaped puppers. He doesnt have time to play around. 
                    Sometimes it is hard to be a single father... 
                    Hang in there Walter, youre doing amazing! 
                    15/12 for dedication!

                <h3> This is Noodles </h3>
                <p>Noodles is on his way to the park. There he will fulfill his duty and bork at all the ducks on the pond.
                Noodles always comes prepared, hence the protection-goggles. Sadly his short legs usually ruin his duck hunt, but he gets the rating 10/10 for trying.
                Better luck next time Noodles.

                <h3>This is Sadie</h3> 
                <p>Sadie has a lot to offer: A cute face, the floofiest fur and tiny adorable paws. But Sadie is in fact not a dog, dont let that cunning smile fool you.
                Since she isnt a dog, this trash-panda sadly cant get any ratings from me. Try somewhere else Sadie?

                <h3>This is Steve</h3>
                <p> Steve has no idea who might have eaten the grilled chicken from the kitchen table, but he is quite sure that the thief is very sorry.
                    He has now has been put on the rocks of shame to think about his chicken crimes.
                    Dont worry Steve, we accept your a-paw-logy. 13/10 would share my chicken with Steve.

        <h3>What is robots.txt?</h3>
        <article class = "answers">
            <p> The robots.txt file`s basic function is to deny (or allow) search engine robots access to different parts of the webpage. These web robots are mostly used to automatically index web content by search engines, however can also be exploited to find email-addresses and other personal information.
                Robot.txt files are commonly used to disallow certain pages from getting accessed by the web robots. Usually more delicate parts of the webpage, such as contact forms are disallowed considering the higher security risk. 
                However this does not mean that the information is private or secure. There are robots that can disregard the robots.txt file and still gain access to all of the content.
                Of course a lot other parts of the webpage can be disallowed as well as just denying certain search engines etc.
                In my case I denied access to  the /contact.html page by writing Disallow: /contact.html in the text file.

            <h3>What is humans.txt?</h3>
        <article class = "answers"> 
            <p>
                Humans.txt is a simple text file with the main purpose of holding all of the information about the developers. 
                Usually people who contributed to the project are credited there, as well as social media/contact information and what kind of software was used to build the website. 
                The Humans.txt file is located in the source folder along with the robots.txt file and is considered a nice feature. The text file is easy and fast to create and does interfere with the code.
                I created one file where I had three basic headers: AUTHOR, META and THANKS.

            <h3>What is Open Graph?</h3>
            <article class = "answers">
                <p> Open graph is a protocol that allows integration between social media pages such as Facebook, the website and user data. This is done by turning the webpage into graph objects through the use of meta tags in the header on each html page. 
                    There are four basic properties that are necessary to be able to create the preview objects: the websites title,the type of the page, a image as well as the URL.
                    Then the RDF object will be created from those parameters by all sites supporting Open Graph. 
                    I used following properties:
                    <br>
                    meta property="og:title" content="I Rate Your Dogs" 
                    <br>
                    meta property="og:type" content="website"   
                    <br>
                    meta property="og:url"content="https://1dv525.github.io/al223zw-examination-1/contact.html" />
                    <br>
                    meta property="og:image" content="Images/ronja.jpg"  />
                    <br>
                    meta property="og:description" content="Assignment 1">

                <h3>Why is it important to seperate the css from the html?</h3>
                <article class = "answers">
                    <p> 
                    There are several performance and architectural reasons for, why separating the CSS from the HTML is considered best practise. 
                    Following points are the ones I can come up with.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                    Firstly, if the CSS and the HTML files are mixed up and some sort of change needs to be done, for example updating some information or a new design implementation, a lot of work will occur since there is no real structure to the project. 
                    If the CSS is on one specified file, the updates would only take place there.
                    Secondly, visually impaired people who need to use Screen Readers to be able to get the webpages information can have a hard time to fully use it if everything is cluttered together. The software needs to have proper semantic structure to work to its full potential.
                    Furthermore if the project may be bigger there can be multiple people working on the same project. Some may work on the styling while the others work on the content. 
                    If everything is mixed up, several errors can occur if many people work on the same file at the same time.
